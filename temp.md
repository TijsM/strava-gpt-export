### **Analysis of Your Strava Training History** From your recent activities, hereâ€™s what stands out: #### **Strengths:** âœ… **Cycling:** Strong endurance and power output (~33-35 km/h average, solid wattage). âœ… **Running:** Good speed (10-12 km/h average) and ability to handle intervals. âœ… **Swim Volume:** You're consistently swimming (~1-2km per session), but efficiency needs work. #### **Weaknesses & Gaps:** âš  **Swim Efficiency:** Your swim pace is slow (~3 km/h), indicating room for technique improvement. âš  **Brick Workouts Missing:** No bike-to-run transitions (critical for Half Ironman pacing). âš  **Run Endurance:** Most runs are under 16kmâ€”need more long, steady efforts. âš  **Recovery Balance:** Some workouts are high-intensity back-to-backâ€”need structured recovery. --- ### **12-Week Half Ironman Training Plan (Sub-6h Goal, ~10h/Week)** #### **Key Principles:** - **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase long bike/run distances. - **Specificity:** Brick workouts, race-pace efforts, open-water swims. - **Recovery:** 1 full rest day + 1 active recovery day per week. - **Intensity Balance:** 80% easy/moderate, 20% hard (polarized training). --- ### **Sample Week (Weeks 4-8, Build Phase)** _(Adjust based on fatigueâ€”listen to your body!)_ | **Day** | **Workout** | **Duration** | **Notes** | |---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------| | **Monday** | **Swim:** 2km (Drills + Threshold Intervals) | 45-50 min | 4x400m at race pace (1:45/100m target), rest 30s. | | **Tuesday** | **Bike:** VO2 Max Intervals (e.g., 6x3min hard, 3min easy) | 60 min | High cadence, Z4-5 effort. | | **Wednesday** | **Run:** Easy Zone 2 + Strides (e.g., 10km easy + 6x20s sprints) | 60 min | Focus on form, keep HR low. | | **Thursday** | **Swim:** Open Water or Endurance (e.g., 1.5km steady + sighting drills) | 40 min | Practice drafting/sighting if possible. | | **Friday** | **Bike:** Tempo Ride (e.g., 2x20min at Half Ironman power, 5min easy) | 75 min | Target ~85% FTP. | | **Saturday** | **Brick Workout:** Bike 60km (race pace) â†’ Run 5km (off the bike, steady) | 3h | Simulate race transitions. | | **Sunday** | **Long Run:** 16-18km Zone 2 (or trail for strength) | 90 min | Keep HR controlled. | **Total Time:** ~10 hours --- ### **Key Adjustments for Your Needs:** 1. **Swim Focus:** - Add **technique drills** (e.g., catch-up, fist swims) 1x/week. - Open-water practice **every 2 weeks** (sighting, drafting). 2. **Brick Workouts:** - Start with short runs off the bike (e.g., 2-3km), progress to 8-10km. 3. **Run Endurance:** - Build long runs to **21km** by Week 10 (easy pace). 4. **Recovery:** - **Post-long workout:** Cold immersion, stretching, protein intake. --- ### **Race-Specific Tips for Sub-6h:** - **Swim (Target: ~35-40 min):** Draft efficiently, sight minimally. - **Bike (Target: ~2h45-2h55):** Hold ~85% FTP, fuel early (60-90g carbs/hour). - **Run (Target: ~1h45-1h55):** Negative splitâ€”start easy, build pace.
